# Shuddo (A data processing and analysing library for Python)

I was hoping to make an efficient and smart data processing library in Python for Engineers. Hopefully, I would create and add more and more functions for everyone to benefit from. I made everything from scratch based on my fundamental knowledge and observations in data. See some examples below :)

![Peaks finding](Peaks%20detection%20data%20mining%20in%20action.png)
![Clusters finding](Cluster%20detection%20data%20mining%20in%20action.png)


To use, just include shuddo directory into your project.
