# Shuddo - A clean data processing and analysing library

I was hoping to make an efficient and smart numerical data processing library in Python for Engineers. Hopefully, I would create and add more and more functions for everyone to benefit from. I made everything from scratch based on my fundamental knowledge and observations in numerical data. This library is written using built-in Python functions so no external libraries are needed. See some examples below :)

![Height values](examples/high.png)
![High Low values](examples/highlow1.png)
![Boundary detection](examples/boundary.png)
![Groups finding](examples/groups_finding.png)
![Signal filtering](examples/aggravate_filter.png)


To use, just include shuddo directory into your project.
