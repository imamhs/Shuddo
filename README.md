# Shuddo - A data processing and analysing library

I was hoping to make an efficient and smart data processing library in Python for Engineers. Hopefully, I would create and add more and more functions for everyone to benefit from. I made everything from scratch based on my fundamental knowledge and observations in data. See some examples below :)

![Data cleaning](examples/clean_data.png)
![Height values](examples/high.png)
![High Low values](examples/highlow1.png)
![Boundary detection](examples/boundary.png)
![Groups finding](examples/groups_finding.png)


To use, just include shuddo directory into your project.

Cheers!
